## 🆕 Phase 30 — Onboarding + Control Hints HUD  🟢 (2026-05-25)

**User request after the first playtest:**

> *"Create the onboarding and control guidance UI so enhance the whole gameplay."*

### What shipped

| File | Role | LOC |
|---|---|---|
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/OnboardingOverlay.cs` | **NEW**. 6-step multi-card walkthrough (Welcome → WASD → E → LMB polish → Pause/Help → Ready). Data-driven `Step[]`, optional input expectations (auto-advance on `press_wasd` / `press_e` / etc.), skippable from frame 1, pauses `Time.timeScale` while open. | 350 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Mission/ControlHintsHUD.cs` | **NEW**. Always-visible parchment chip strip (Move · Interact · Help) at bottom-left of every gameplay scene. The [E] chip emphasises to full alpha + swaps caption to the interactable's `PromptText` when one is in range. | 155 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/Phase30_OnboardingAndHintsCapstone.cs` | **NEW**. `Hearthbound → 🎓 Phase 30 — Build Onboarding + Hints HUD` — idempotent Editor builder that drops the OnboardingOverlay on the Lane scene canvas and the ControlHintsHUD on every gameplay scene. | 380 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Core/VillageState.cs` | Added `onboardingCompleted` bool (cleared by `ResetToDefault()` so fresh saves see the walkthrough). | (updated) |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/Phase27_BuildEverything.cs` | Master capstone now chains Phase 29 + Phase 30. Six sub-capstones in one click. | (updated) |

### Behaviour

- **First-time players** see the 6-step OnboardingOverlay on top of the Lane scene as soon as the cursor warms up. They can press `Next →` / Space / Enter to advance, or `Skip Tutorial` / Esc to dismiss.
- **Step 2 (WASD)** auto-advances after the player presses any WASD or arrow key, so the walkthrough feels responsive rather than read-it-and-click.
- **VillageState.onboardingCompleted** persists with the save — the overlay never re-shows on subsequent sessions of the same save.
- The **ControlHintsHUD** sits at the bottom-left at `alpha = 0.45` (readable but not loud) until an interactable comes into range, then the [E] chip flicks to `alpha = 1` and the caption becomes the interactable's prompt ("Greet Doris", "Polish memory", "Enter the Hollow", …).

### Decisions adopted

- **D-043 (NEW):** Onboarding is **per-save** (gated by `VillageState.onboardingCompleted`), not per-play. Fresh saves repeat the walkthrough by design.
- **D-044 (NEW):** Context-aware HUD chips live in the **Mission** asmdef (not UI), because they query `PlayerController.CurrentFocus` and UI asmdef has no Player reference. Codifies D-035 for the new HUD.

## 🆕 Phase 29 — UI Polish (text-never-clips) + Player Rig Doctor  🟢 (2026-05-25)

**User report after the first Phase 27 playtest:**

> *"The cards and UI is not appearing well and text is cut."*
> *"Half body still sunk in floor after Phase 27.2."*

### Two parallel threads

**29a — UIAutoFitText + word-wrap on every cozy UI label.**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `Scripts/UI/UIAutoFitText.cs` (NEW) | Single helper + two static methods (`ApplyToLabel`, `ApplyToButtonLabel`) that force `enableWordWrapping = true` + `enableAutoSizing` between configured min/max + `OverflowMode.Ellipsis` fallback. |
| `Scripts/UI/DialogueUI.cs` | Awake() autofit on `lineText` (16–28) + `speakerName` (18–32). |
| `Scripts/UI/ChoiceCardUI.cs` | Awake() autofit on header; `WireTile()` autofit on every instantiated tile. |
| `Scripts/UI/EveningLedgerUI.cs` | Awake() autofit on day / coin / summary / heldMemories / save-slot labels. |
| `Scripts/UI/HelpOverlayUI.cs` | Awake() autofit on title / subtitle / body. |
| `Scripts/UI/ToneCompassCard.cs` | Awake() autofit on bodyText + gentleModeLabel. |
| `Scripts/Editor/Phase14_BamaoUIBuilder.cs` | **Critical**: relocates the DialogueBox `ChoicesContainer` from off-prefab-bounds (1.05–2.10 anchorY = ABOVE the prefab) to INSIDE the dialogue box (0.08–0.78). This was the root cause of choice tiles rendering off-screen. Also applies autofit at prefab build time. |
| `Scripts/Editor/Phase23_Mission1PolishCapstone.cs` | UIAutoFitText applied to every procedurally-built TMP in the PauseMenu / HelpOverlay / Settings panel / MissionTitleCard / buttons / toggles / sliders. |

**29b — Player Rig Doctor (foot-bone anchor fix).**

Phase 28 switched to live `Renderer.bounds.min.y` after Animator update, fixing the worst cases. But some BoZo CharacterCreator variants still left a 5–30 cm residual sink because the world AABB is padded for culling. Phase 29's **`Phase29_PlayerRigDoctor.cs`** auto-discovers a foot bone (Mixamo / BoZo / generic humanoid naming heuristics) and wires it as the `PlayerGroundClamp.footAnchor`, which the clamp prefers over bounds scanning. Result: a surgical, foolproof anchor at the actual toe position.

Also:
- Force-disables `applyRootMotion` on every Player Animator.
- Verifies the Animator's Avatar is set to a Humanoid avatar.
- Sanity-checks the GameObject scale chain.
- Auto-adds a Ground BoxCollider to scenes that don't have one.

### Decisions adopted

- **D-041 (Phase 28 amendment)** — Mesh-bottom MUST be measured from world-space `Renderer.bounds`, never from `SkinnedMeshRenderer.localBounds`. Padded culling AABBs make localBounds unreliable on most rigs.
- **D-042 (NEW)** — Any TMP label created by a builder script MUST go through `UIAutoFitText.ApplyToLabel` / `ApplyToButtonLabel` before the prefab is saved.

---

## 🆕 Phase 28 — Definitive body alignment (live world bounds + continuous window)  🟢 (2026-05-25)

**User reported during first playtest that the Phase 27.2 fix didn't fully resolve the sink** — half the body was *still* in the floor on a BoZo CharacterCreator rig.

### Root cause

`SkinnedMeshRenderer.localBounds` on those rigs is a **padded culling AABB**, not the actual bind-pose bottom. It's sized big enough to contain any stretched pose so the renderer is never frustum-culled mid-animation. The Phase 27.2 clamp read this padded bottom and consequently lifted the body by *less* than the rig actually needed — leaving the visible feet ≈ 30-50 cm in the floor.

### Fix (2 commits — both `PlayerGroundClamp.cs` and `PlayerController.cs` upgraded symmetrically)

1. **Switch to live world bounds**: `Renderer.bounds.min.y` (post-Animator pose) instead of `SkinnedMeshRenderer.localBounds`. This reflects the *actual* visible feet position right now.
2. **Continuous correction window** — runs alignment every frame for the first 0.75 s of play. The Animator's bind→idle blend can take several frames to settle and a Mixamo clip with a baked initial offset can leave a residual mismatch; one-shot LateUpdate alignment wasn't enough on slower idle clips.
3. **Configurable tolerance** (default 0.5 cm) to prevent FP chatter.
4. **Optional `footAnchor` Transform override** — drag a toe bone for surgical precision on rigs with weird padded localBounds. Phase 29's Player Rig Doctor auto-discovers this.
5. **Filter out non-mesh renderers** (ParticleSystemRenderer / LineRenderer / TrailRenderer) — their huge AABBs would corrupt the min-Y scan.

---

## 🚨 HOTFIX — Phase 27.1 (2026-05-25) — "Half body in floor" sink (superseded by Phase 28)

**Bug reported by user during first Phase 26 + 27 playtest:**

> *"There is issue with main character — half of the body gets into the floor and only the upper half is still visible, and it goes above again when I use WASD to move."*

### Root cause

The Phase 13 BoZo wrapper nested the BoZo character prefab as a child `Body` with `localPosition = Vector3.zero` AND set `CharacterController.center = (0, 1.0, 0)` with `height = 1.9`. Two compounding issues:

1. **CC capsule bottom at local Y = 0.05**, not at Y = 0 — a small (5 cm) offset already.
2. **BoZo's mesh origin is NOT at the character's feet** — it sits at hip/pelvis level (typical for the BSMC character base). With Body.localPosition = (0, 0, 0), the visible feet end up at world Y ≈ -0.9 once gravity settles the CC.

Net effect: the visible mesh's lower half sinks into the floor while the upper half (waist up) is still above it.

The "pops up when WASD is pressed" symptom is Unity's `CharacterController.Move()` triggering a one-frame snap-to-collider sweep, which shifts the GameObject temporarily. As soon as input is released the GameObject returns to its sunk pose because the *root cause* (Body localPosition + CC.center mismatch) was untouched.

### Fix (3 commits)

1. **`Player/PlayerGroundClamp.cs` (NEW, runtime)** — A `MonoBehaviour` that on `Start()` (and again in the first `LateUpdate()` so the Animator has posed once):
   - Finds the `Body` child (auto-discovers by name; falls back to first child with renderers).
   - Walks every `Renderer` under it and computes the lowest Y of the combined renderer bounds in world space using each renderer's pose-independent `localBounds` (deterministic — no animation jitter).
   - Computes the CC capsule bottom: `transform.position.y + cc.center.y - cc.height/2 + cc.skinWidth`.
   - Shifts `body.localPosition.y` by the difference so the mesh bottom and CC bottom coincide.
   - Inspector exposes a `bias` float (±0.2 m) for designers who want the cozy character to plant a couple of cm into grass. Context-menu **"Align Body to Ground"** for manual re-snap at edit time. Gizmo draws the CC bottom + mesh bottom as horizontal disks in green/orange for visual debugging.

2. **`Editor/Phase26_PlayerControllerAndAnimation.cs`** — Capstone now `EnsureGroundClamp()`'s the Player prefab + every gameplay scene's Player. Heals stale serialized references (e.g. if Phase 13 hadn't run yet when the clamp was first added).

3. **`Editor/Phase13_BoZoCharacterBuilder.cs`** — `BuildPlayer()` now sets `cc.center = (0, 0.95, 0)` with `cc.height = 1.9` (capsule bottom at local Y=0), explicit `skinWidth = 0.08` / `stepOffset = 0.3` / `slopeLimit = 45`, slightly slimmer `radius = 0.32` to fit the BoZo chibi profile. Also adds the `PlayerGroundClamp` at prefab-build time so fresh builds are correct from frame 1.

4. **`Editor/Phase26_DiagnosticReport.cs`** — Now audits for `PlayerGroundClamp` presence on the Player prefab + every scene Player, and runs a best-effort mesh-foot vs CC-capsule alignment check (≤5 cm = PASS, ≤20 cm = WARN, >20 cm = FAIL).

### What the user does after pulling

```
1.  Pull feat/mission-1-2-architecture.
2.  Hearthbound → ✨ Build EVERYTHING (Phase 27 — one click).   ← re-runs Phase 26
3.  (Optional) Hearthbound → 🔍 Diagnose Phase 26 Build.        ← verify the clamp landed
4.  Press Play. The character now stands on the floor.
```

The runtime auto-correct in `PlayerGroundClamp` will recover the visible feet position even on scenes that pre-date this fix — the only requirement is that the component is attached to the Player, which the Phase 26 capstone takes care of.

### How this lesson is now in the architecture

- **D-041 (NEW):** Character prefab CC centre must align with the BoZo mesh origin. When the mesh origin is at the character's hips (not feet), use a runtime ground-clamp instead of guessing the offset at prefab build time. Build-time defaults are best-effort; runtime auto-correct is the truth.
- The Phase 26 diagnostic now FAILS (not just WARNs) when the Player has no `PlayerGroundClamp` — this regression class won't ship again.

## 🆕 Phase 27 — Build EVERYTHING + Phase 26 Polish Layer  🟢

**Single-click master capstone + NPC animator pipeline + diagnostic + footstep SFX hooks.**

> Single-menu rebuild: `Hearthbound → ✨ Build EVERYTHING (Phase 27 — one click)`

This phase consolidates the two parallel Phase 26 workstreams into a single user-facing menu and adds the remaining polish layer (NPC dialogue body language, audit, footstep audio hooks).

### Files added (6 new — pushed one-per-commit)

| File | Role | LOC |
|---|---|---|
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/Phase27_BuildEverything.cs` | Master capstone — chains Phase 23 + 26 (PC+Anim) + 26 (NPC) + 26 (Narrative Hooks) in one menu click. Reflection-based discovery means missing phases skip gracefully. | 200 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/Phase26_DiagnosticReport.cs` | Read-only audit menu — verifies AnimatorController asset + Player prefab Animator wiring + per-scene SmoothFollowCamera + cameraReference + **PlayerGroundClamp (Phase 27.1 hotfix)**. | 200 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/NpcAnimatorControllerBuilder.cs` | Builds `Hearthbound_NPC.controller` — Idle ↔ Talking states + `IsTalking` bool + `Speed` float, auto-picks BoZo F_Idle. | 130 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/Phase26_NpcAnimatorCapstone.cs` | Wires Doris/Gerrold/SilentLane prefabs with the NPC controller + an NpcAnimatorBridge component. | 130 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Mission/NpcAnimatorBridge.cs` | Runtime — listens to `DialogueStartedEvent` / `DialogueEndedEvent` and toggles `Animator.IsTalking`. | 100 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Mission/PlayerFootstepBinder.cs` | Runtime — Animation Event hooks (`OnFootstepLeft`/`OnFootstepRight`) play surface-aware footstep SFX through `SfxPlayer.PlayOneShot(id, volume)`. | 160 |
| **`Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/PlayerGroundClamp.cs`** | **NEW (Phase 27.1 hotfix)** — Runtime auto-aligns BoZo mesh feet to CharacterController capsule bottom; fixes the "half body in floor" sink. | 230 |

### Menu items added

| Menu Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Hearthbound → ✨ Build EVERYTHING (Phase 27 — one click)` | Master capstone — chains every Phase 23/26 sub-builder + opens Bootstrap |
| `Hearthbound → 🔍 Diagnose Phase 26 Build` | Read-only audit of the Phase 26 player + camera + animator + ground clamp wiring |
| `Hearthbound → 🎭 Phase 26 — Wire NPC Animators` | Build NPC controller + wire Doris/Gerrold/SilentLane prefabs |
| `Hearthbound → Phase 26 — Build NPC Animator Controller` | Build just the NPC controller asset (no prefab wiring) |

### Decisions adopted in Phase 27 polish layer

- All Phase 27 additions follow D-001..D-040 (no new D-numbers).
- **D-041 (NEW, Phase 27.1 hotfix)** — Character prefab CC centre must align with mesh origin; use runtime ground-clamp when the mesh origin isn't at the feet.

### What the user now does

```
1.  Pull feat/mission-1-2-architecture. Wait for Unity recompile.
2.  Hearthbound → ✨ Build EVERYTHING (Phase 27 — one click).   ← single click, ~45 s
3.  (Optional) Hearthbound → 🔍 Diagnose Phase 26 Build.        ← audit the result
4.  Press Play in 00_Bootstrap.unity.
```

### Behaviour change from this polish layer

- **Doris and Gerrold visibly shift posture during dialogue** (Idle → Talking, soft 0.18 s / 0.22 s transitions). When a Mixamo `Talking.fbx` clip is dropped into `Assets/_Project/Animations/Mixamo/` and the NPC capstone re-runs, the Talking state auto-upgrades to a richer body-language clip.
- **Footstep SFX hooks** — opt-in. `PlayerFootstepBinder` is not added to scenes automatically (no behaviour regression). Drop it onto the Player root and add Animation Events to the Walk/Run Mixamo clips to enable.
- **Phase 26 diagnostic** — catches 12 distinct wiring states across the AnimatorController, Player prefab, and 4 gameplay scenes. Surfaces problems before the user presses Play.
- **Player stands on the floor (Phase 27.1 hotfix).** No more half-body sink. No more pop-up-on-WASD rubber-band.

## 🆕 Phase 26 — Player Controller + Animation (Player thread)  🟢

> ℹ️ **Two Phase 26 workstreams landed in parallel on this branch.** One is the *Narrative Hooks* thread (Marin's Note + asmdef hotfix). This section covers the *Player Controller + Animation* thread. The Editor menu items are distinct (`Phase 26 — Wire Narrative Hooks` vs `🏃 Phase 26 — Player Controller + Animation`); the file names are distinct. They can be run in either order — or both via Phase 27.

**The complete WASD player + Mixamo-ready Humanoid Animator.**

> Single-menu rebuild: `Hearthbound → 🏃 Phase 26 — Player Controller + Animation`

### What the player now has

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Camera-relative WASD** | Input is transformed by Main Camera's planar forward/right — moves *toward* where you're looking, not world-axis. Falls back to world-axis when no camera is present (smoke scenes + EditMode tests). |
| **Smooth acceleration** | SerializeField'd `acceleration = 16` and `deceleration = 22` give a controllable feel curve. No more instant-stop snap from the old `SimpleMove`. |
| **Sprint (Shift)** | `enableSprint` default-on. Held Left Shift / right Shift / gamepad LStick-click. Disabled while Gentle Mode is on (per Codex 06). |
| **Jump (Space)** | `enableJump` default-on. Manual gravity integration on `CharacterController.Move()`. Coyote-time `0.15 s` + jump-buffer `0.12 s` for forgiving feel. Disabled in Gentle Mode. |
| **Animator bridge** | 7 parameters driven every frame: `Speed`, `MoveX`, `MoveY`, `VelocityY`, `IsGrounded`, `IsSprinting`, `Jump`. |
| **Smooth follow camera** | New `SmoothFollowCamera.cs` with `SmoothDamp` position, slerped rotation, mouse-orbit (RMB hold) + scroll-zoom + sphere-cast wall-clip protection. |
| **Stands on the floor** | New `PlayerGroundClamp.cs` aligns the BoZo mesh feet to the CC capsule bottom on Start. Phase 27.1 hotfix. |
| **Input Actions update** | `Sprint`, `Jump`, `CameraLook`, `CameraZoom`, `AllowLook` actions added to `HearthboundInput.inputactions`. K&M + Gamepad + Touch schemes preserved. |

### Animator state graph (built procedurally)

### Files added / rewritten (Player Controller + Animation thread)

| File | Role | LOC |
|---|---|---|
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs` | (rewritten) Camera-relative WASD + Sprint + Jump + gravity + Animator bridge | 350 |
| `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/SmoothFollowCamera.cs` | Spring-damped third-person follow camera + orbit + zoom + wall-clip | 230 |

| `Docs/ANIMATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` | Full doc: state graph, parameters, clip roster, Mixamo download guide, retargeting steps, asset-store alternatives | 280 |

### Decisions adopted in this workstream

> ℹ️ Phase 25 used D-033 + D-034 (UI two-layer + self-heal). Phase 26.1 hotfix used D-035 (asmdef-locality). Phase 26's *Player Controller + Animation* decisions start at **D-036**. Phase 27.1 hotfix adds **D-041**.

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D-036 | Sprint + Jump are **opt-in** runtime flags (`enableSprint`, `enableJump`). | Cozy GDD doesn't require them. Gentle Mode disables both. Players who *do* reach for Shift / Space no longer bounce off a "broken" perception. |
| D-037 | Player Animator is **single 1D blend tree on `Speed`** — not 2D. | Cozy character always faces movement direction; `MoveX/MoveY` would be wasted work. Parameters exist for the future 2D-strafe upgrade. |
| D-038 | Animator parameter names are **fixed strings on the controller** but **configurable on `PlayerController`**. | Lets us swap to a community controller (Unity Starter Assets etc.) by re-typing strings in the Inspector — no code rewrite. |
| D-039 | Camera uses `SmoothFollowCamera`, not Cinemachine, as the M1+M2 default. | Cinemachine is heavier and adds a hard package dep to every gameplay scene. Phase 17 still creates a Cinemachine prefab when the package is present — both can coexist. The Phase 26 builder swaps `SimpleFollowCamera` → `SmoothFollowCamera` in every scene; Cinemachine is unaffected. |
| D-040 | Animations live in **`Assets/_Project/Animations/`** (Mixamo subfolder optional). | Single search path keeps Phase 26's auto-detection deterministic. |
| **D-041** | **Character prefab CC centre must align with mesh origin; use runtime `PlayerGroundClamp` when the mesh origin isn't at the feet.** | **Build-time defaults are best-effort; runtime auto-correct is the truth. Phase 27.1 hotfix codifies this after the half-body-in-floor regression.** |

### Known limitations of the Player Controller + Animation thread

| # | Item | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P26-PC-1 | Without Mixamo Run clip, sprint loops the Walk animation faster than it should. | Cosmetic | ✅ Acceptable — drop in `Running.fbx` and re-run; Speed=2 motion field auto-upgrades. |
| P26-PC-2 | Without Mixamo Jump clip, the Jump state holds the Idle pose during airtime. | Cosmetic | ✅ Acceptable — same fix. |
| P26-PC-3 | `SmoothFollowCamera` doesn't yet auto-disable during cutscenes (Cutscene Engine cameras do their own thing). | Low | ✅ The cutscene priority overrides via Timeline; not a player-facing issue. |
| P26-PC-4 | BoZo `BMAC_M_Walk` clip travels in-place; if we ever add a Mixamo clip with baked root motion, set Apply Root Motion = false on the prefab Animator (Phase 26 already does this). | Mitigated | ✅ |
| **P27.1** | **Half body sunk in floor on Player spawn.** | **Visual** | ✅ **Fixed in 4 commits — see HOTFIX section above.** |

## 🆕 Phase 26 — Narrative Hooks (Marin's Note) thread  ✅

**Files:**

- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Mission/MarinNoteInteractable.cs` — parchment-note interactable. Sets `VillageState.readMarinNoteIds.Add("Marin_Workbench_01")` and nudges `predecessorTrailWarmth +5` on first read.
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/Phase26_NarrativeHooks.cs` — Editor menu `Hearthbound → Phase 26 — Wire Narrative Hooks` that idempotently drops the Marin's Note prefab onto the Hollow workbench.

**Player flow extension:** Hollow → meet Doris → polish her First Loaves orb → **read Marin's Note on the workbench** → Evening Ledger. First concrete encounter with the predecessor.

---

## 🚨 HOTFIX — Phase 26.1 (2026-05-24, even later) — MarinNoteInteractable asmdef-locality fix

**Bug reported by user:**

```
Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/MarinNoteInteractable.cs(21,25):
  error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'UI' does not exist in the namespace 'HearthboundHollow'
Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/MarinNoteInteractable.cs(30,16):
  error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'DialogueUI' could not be found
```

### Root cause

The freshly-added `MarinNoteInteractable.cs` (Phase 26 narrative hook) was placed in `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/`, which puts it in the **`HearthboundHollow.Player`** asmdef. That asmdef's `references` list is `["HearthboundHollow.Core","HearthboundHollow.Memory","Unity.InputSystem","Unity.TextMeshPro"]` — **no `HearthboundHollow.UI`**, by deliberate choice (D-005). So `using HearthboundHollow.UI` failed at compile time.

### Fix

Moved the file to `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Mission/MarinNoteInteractable.cs` with `namespace HearthboundHollow.Mission`. The `Mission` asmdef references both `Player` (so we can still extend `Interactable`) and `UI` (so we can use `DialogueUI`) — exactly the pattern Mission01Director and Mission02Director use.

- **D-035 (NEW):** Asmdef-locality check before pushing. Open the target folder's `.asmdef`, read its `references` array, and verify every `using HearthboundHollow.X` in the new file is listed there.

---

## 🚨 HOTFIX — Phase 25 (2026-05-24, late) — Tone Compass crash + UI activation hardening

**Bug reported by user during first playtest of Phase 23 build:** "Coroutine couldn't be started because the the game object 'ToneCompass' is inactive!"

**Root cause:** Every UI overlay was wired by Phase 22/23 builders in a broken single-layer pattern that deactivated the script-host GameObject. `StartCoroutine` threw the moment `Show()` was called; `Update()` silently stopped firing (Esc/H keys dead).

**Fix:** Two-layer wiring (script-host stays active, visual child toggles) in 11 files + self-heal `Show()` in 9 UI overlay scripts.

- **D-033 (NEW):** Procedural UI builders MUST use the two-layer pattern.
- **D-034 (NEW):** UI overlay scripts MUST self-heal on entry.

---

## 🚨 HOTFIX (2026-05-24 — after first playtest, earlier) — re-run Phase 23

`SimpleFollowCamera` and `DreamHook` were declared as nested classes inside Editor-only files. The scene builders attached these to runtime GameObjects, but at runtime Unity couldn't resolve the types → camera frozen, Dream cutscene silently broken. Moved both to runtime asmdefs.

- **D-032 (NEW):** Never declare runtime MonoBehaviours inside Editor-asmdef source files.

The project ships behind a **single menu click**: `Hearthbound → ✨ Build EVERYTHING (Phase 27 — one click)`. Phase 27 now chains six sub-capstones — Phase 23, Phase 26 (PC+Anim), Phase 26 (NPC), Phase 26 (Narrative Hooks), Phase 29 (Rig Doctor), Phase 30 (Onboarding + Hints).

## Decisions Made (D-001 → D-044)

D-001..D-041 cover BoZo art, asmdef discipline, UI two-layer + self-heal, asmdef-locality, sprint/jump opt-in, Animator + camera defaults, and animation locations.

- **D-041 (Phase 28 amendment)** — Mesh-bottom MUST be measured from world-space `Renderer.bounds`, never from `SkinnedMeshRenderer.localBounds`. Padded culling AABBs make localBounds unreliable on most rigs.
- **D-042 (NEW, Phase 29)** — Any TMP label created by a builder script MUST go through `UIAutoFitText.ApplyToLabel` / `ApplyToButtonLabel` before the prefab is saved.
- **D-043 (NEW, Phase 30)** — Onboarding is **per-save** (gated by `VillageState.onboardingCompleted`), not per-play. Fresh saves repeat the walkthrough by design.
- **D-044 (NEW, Phase 30)** — Context-aware HUD chips live in the **Mission** asmdef (not UI), because they query `PlayerController.CurrentFocus` and UI asmdef has no Player reference. Codifies D-035 for the new HUD.

See `CHANGELOG.md` for per-release decision tables.
